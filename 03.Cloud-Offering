->Cloud-Offering: It refers to how AWS delivers IT resources—such as compute, storage, networking, databases, security, analytics, and software—over the internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model, classified 
                  by management responsibility.
->Types of Cloud-Offering
1.IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
2.PaaS – Platform as a Service
3.SaaS – Software as a Service

1.Iaas-(Infrastructure as a Service)
       It provides raw infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. The customer controls everything above the hardware.
->Responsibility Model
->AWS manages: Data centers, physical servers, networking hardware
->Customer manages: OS, middleware, runtime, applications, data, security inside OS

->AWS IaaS Services
i.Amazon EC2 – Virtual servers
ii. Amazon EBS – Block storage
iii . Amazon VPC – Networking
iv . Elastic Load Balancer
v.Elastic IP
vi. Auto Scaling

->Practical Use Cases
i.Legacy application migration
ii. Custom OS configurations
iii. Full control over security and software
iv. Compliance-heavy workloads

->Practical Setup Example (Database on IaaS)
Step:1:Create VPC
Step:2:Create Public & Private Subnets
Step:3:Configure Route Tables
Step:4:Set up Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway
Step:5:Launch EC2 Instance
Step:6:Install OS Updates
Step 7: Install Database Software (MySQL)
Step:8:Configure Security (Firewall, Users)
Step:9:Set Up Manual Backups
Step:10:Monitor & Patch System

2.PaaS (Platform as a Service)
        It provides a managed platform where AWS handles infrastructure and OS, so customers can focus on the application and data.
->Responsibility Model
->AWS manages: Infrastructure, OS, patching, availability, scaling
->Customer manages: Application logic, data, configuration

->AWS PaaS Services
i.Amazon RDS
ii. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
iii. AWS App Runner
iv. Amazon ECS with Fargate

->Practical Use Cases
i.Web applications
ii.APIs
iii. Microservices
iv . Managed databases
v.Faster development cycles

->Practical Setup Example (Database on PaaS – RDS)
Step:1-Choose DB Engine (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
Step:2-Launch RDS Instance
Step:3-AWS Automatically Handles:
      - OS & DB installation
      - Patching
      - Backups
      - Monitoring
     - High availability (Multi-AZ)
Step:4:Customer Handles:
- Schema
- Queries
- Data

3.SaaS (Software as a Service)
       It delivers fully functional applications over the internet. The customer only uses the software.
->Responsibility Model
->AWS manages: Everything
->Customer manages: Usage and access

->AWS SaaS Services
i.Amazon WorkSpaces
ii. Amazon Chime
iii . Amazon QuickSight
iv. AWS Managed Grafana
v.AWS Managed Prometheus

->Practical Use Cases
i. Business intelligence
ii. Collaboration tools
iii. Virtual desktops
iv. Monitoring dashboards

->Practical Example
Step 1- Log in to AWS Console
Step 2:- Open SaaS Service
Step:3:- Configure Users
Step:4:- Use Application

->What is the use of cloud offerings in AWS?
A. The cloud offering is to define how cloud services are delivered and managed, helping users choose the right service model (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) based on the level of control, responsibility, 
   and management required.
