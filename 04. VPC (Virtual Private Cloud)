*AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
                   A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated virtual network in AWS where you can launch and manage your cloud resources securely. It gives you full 
                   control over:
                  Subnets
                  Routing
                  Security
                  Network gateways
*Types of VPC in AWS
->Default VPC: Automatically created in each region when you create an AWS account.
Features:
Ready-to-use
Contains public subnets
Internet access enabled
Easy for beginners
Example: Launching a quick test EC2 instance without configuring networking.

->Custom VPC: Created manually, providing full control over configuration.
Features:
Custom IP range (CIDR)
Public and private subnets
Custom routing
More secure architecture
Example: Production web app with separate public (web servers) and private (database) networks.

->Types of Subnets in AWS
i.Public Subnet – Instances are accessible from the Internet (via IGW).
ii. Private Subnet – Instances have no direct inbound Internet access; outbound access possible via NAT Gateway.

->Components of a VPC
1. CIDR Block (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
Defines the IP address range for the VPC.
Example: 10.0.0.0/16

->Subnets: A subnet is a smaller network inside a VPC, or a logical subdivision of a VPC IP range.
Types of Subnet:
2. Public Subnet: Route table has a route to an Internet Gateway, and instances have public IPs.
Example: Web server accessible from the Internet.

3. Private Subnet: No direct inbound Internet access; outbound Internet access via NAT Gateway.
Example: Database server for security.

4. Internet Gateway (IGW)
Enables communication between the VPC and the Internet.
Example: Users accessing your website hosted on EC2.

5. Route Table
Defines how traffic flows within the VPC.
Example: Route 0.0.0.0/0 → IGW sends Internet traffic to the gateway.

7. Security Groups
Acts as a virtual firewall at the instance level.
Example: Allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22).

8. Network ACL (NACL)
Firewall at the subnet level.
Example: Allow HTTP but deny a specific IP address.

9. NAT Gateway / NAT Instance
Enables private subnet resources to access the Internet without exposing them.
Example: Private EC2 instance downloading updates.

10. Elastic IP
Static public IPv4 address.
Example: Fixed IP for a production server.

11. VPC Peering
Connects two VPCs privately.
Example: Connect development and production environments.

12. VPN Gateway
Provides a secure connection between the on-premises network and the VPC.
Example: Company office network connecting to AWS.

13. VPC Endpoints (Advanced)
Enables private access to AWS services (like S3 or DynamoDB) without using the Internet or a NAT Gateway.
Example: Private EC2 accessing S3 directly.

14. Flow Logs (Monitoring & Security)
Captures all network traffic in/out of VPC, subnets, or ENIs.
Example: Auditing traffic for security or troubleshooting.

15. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Integration (Advanced Architecture)
Typically deployed in public subnets to distribute traffic to private instances.
Example: Public ELB → Private web servers → Private databases.

16. VPC Best Practices
Use private subnets for databases and critical systems.
Use security groups as stateful firewalls; NACLs as stateless firewalls.
Deploy subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
Consider VPC Endpoints for private access to AWS services.
Monitor traffic using VPC Flow Logs.

<--------------------AWS VPC Labs (Step-by-Step)-------------------->
Step 1 — Create VPC
Go to the VPC Dashboard → Click Create VPC → Select VPC Only
Enter details:
Name → My-Lab-VPC
CIDR → 10.0.0.0/16
Tenancy → Default → Click Create

Step 2 — Create Subnets
Public Subnet:
Go to Subnets → Create Subnet
Name → Public-Subnet
AZ → Any (e.g., ap-south-1a)
CIDR → 10.0.1.0/24 → Create
Private Subnet:
Create another subnet
Name → Private-Subnet
AZ → Same or different
CIDR → 10.0.2.0/24 → Create

Step 3 — Create Internet Gateway (IGW)
Go to Internet Gateways → Click Create
Name → My-IGW → Attach to VPC

Step 4 — Create Route Table for Public Subnet
Go to Route Tables → Create
Name → Public-RT → Select VPC → My-Lab-VPC
Edit routes:
Add route: Destination → 0.0.0.0/0, Target → Internet Gateway

Step 5 — Create NAT Gateway
Go to NAT Gateways → Click Create
Subnet → Public Subnet → Allocate Elastic IP → Create

Step 6 — Create Private Route Table
Create new route table → Name → Private-RT
Edit routes:
Add route: Destination → 0.0.0.0/0, Target → NAT Gateway

Step 7 — Launch EC2 in Public Subnet
Go to EC2 → Launch Instance
Name → Public-EC2
Network → My-Lab-VPC, Subnet → Public Subnet
Auto-assign Public IP → Enable
Create Security Group → Allow SSH (22)

Step 8 — Launch EC2 in Private Subnet
Launch another instance
Name → Private-EC2
Subnet → Private Subnet
Public IP → Disable
Security Group → Allow SSH from Public EC2 only

Step 9 — Connect to Private EC2 (via Public EC2)
SSH into Public EC2 → Then SSH into Private EC2 using private IP
