*High Availability & Fault Tolerance
-->If you are storing data like one E-Commerce application (like Myntra), you definitely need these characteristics.
1. AWS Security: It provides strong security to protect application data and users.
2. AWS High Availability: If the application is always accessible, even if one server fails,
3. AWS Fault-Tolerance: It means the system continues working even when failures occur.
4. AWS Scalability: It allows the application to handle traffic changes automatically.

*AWS Security: It is a collection of services, controls, and best practices that protect applications, data, and infrastructure using identity management, network security, encryption, monitoring, and compliance.
->Real-Time Scenario- IAM roles (least privilege), private subnets, security groups, encrypted RDS, GuardDuty, CloudTrail

*AWS High-Availability: It is a system design approach where an application continues to operate with minimal or no downtime even if one or more servers or Availability Zones fail.
->Real-Time Scenario- If one EC2 instance fails in an e-commerce application, the Application Load Balancer routes traffic to healthy instances in another Availability Zone, ensuring the application 
                      remains accessible.

*AWS Fault-Tolerance: It is the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption even when a component fails, by using duplicate resources running simultaneously.\
->Real-Time Scenario - An e-commerce application utilizes Multi-AZ RDS with synchronous replication.
                       If the primary database fails, AWS automatically switches to the standby database with no data loss and no downtime.

*AWS Scalability: It is the ability of AWS infrastructure to automatically adjust resources to handle varying application loads efficiently.
->Real-Time Scenario- During a festival sale, an e-commerce application experiences heavy traffic.
                      AWS Auto Scaling automatically launches new EC2 instances to handle the load and terminates them when traffic decreases.
